    <p>We focus on the development of neo-organs and neo-tissues generated from each patient's own (autologous) cells. To create a neo-organ or neo-tissue, a small amount of the patient's tissue is obtained by biopsy, and progenitors of the desired specialized cell types are recovered and expanded in culture. The cells are then seeded onto a bioresorbable scaffold which provides shape and structure. The neo-organ is surgically implanted into the patient, and the seeded cells continue to grow and differentiate while the scaffold gradually dissolves away.</p>
